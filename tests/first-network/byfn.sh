# This script will orchestrate a sample end-to-end execution of the Hyperledger
# Fabric network.
#
# The end-to-end verification provisions a sample Fabric network consisting of
# two organizations, each maintaining two peers, and a “solo” ordering service.
#
# This verification makes use of two fundamental tools, which are necessary to
# create a functioning transactional network with digital signature validation
# and access control:
#
# * cryptogen - generates the x509 certificates used to identify and
#   authenticate the various components in the network.
# * configtxgen - generates the requisite configuration artifacts for orderer
#   bootstrap and channel creation.
#
# Each tool consumes a configuration yaml file, within which we specify the topology
# of our network (cryptogen) and the location of our certificates for various
# configuration operations (configtxgen).  Once the tools have been successfully run,
# we are able to launch our network.  More detail on the tools and the structure of
# the network will be provided later in this document.  For now, let's get going...

# prepending $PWD/../bin to PATH to ensure we are picking up the correct binaries
# this may be commented out to resolve installed version of tools if desired

# specific components (peers and orderers) to that Org.  Transactions and communications
# within Fabric are signed by an entity's private key (``keystore``), and then verified
# by means of a public key (``signcerts``).  You will notice a "count" variable within
# this file.  We use this to specify the number of peers per Organization; in our
# case it's two peers per Org.  The rest of this template is extremely

# The `configtxgen tool is used to create four artifacts: orderer **bootstrap
# block**, fabric **channel configuration transaction**, and two **anchor
# peer transactions** - one for each Peer Org.
#
# The orderer block is the genesis block for the ordering service, and the
# channel transaction file is broadcast to the orderer at channel creation
# time.  The anchor peer transactions, as the name might suggest, specify each
# Org's anchor peer on this channel.
#
# Configtxgen consumes a file - ``configtx.yaml`` - that contains the definitions
# for the sample network. There are three members - one Orderer Org (``OrdererOrg``)
# and two Peer Orgs (``Org1`` & ``Org2``) each managing and maintaining two peer nodes.
# This file also specifies a consortium - ``SampleConsortium`` - consisting of our
# two Peer Orgs.  Pay specific attention to the "Profiles" section at the top of
# this file.  You will notice that we have two unique headers. One for the orderer genesis
# block - ``TwoOrgsOrdererGenesis`` - and one for our channel - ``TwoOrgsChannel``.
# These headers are important, as we will pass them in as arguments when we create
# our artifacts.  This file also contains two additional specifications that are worth
# noting.  Firstly, we specify the anchor peers for each Peer Org
# (``peer0.org1.example.com`` & ``peer0.org2.example.com``).  Secondly, we point to
# the location of the MSP directory for each member, in turn allowing us to store the
# root certificates for each Org in the orderer genesis block.  This is a critical
# concept. Now any network entity communicating with the ordering service can have
# its digital signature verified.
#

# artifacts, and subsequently output these files into the ``channel-artifacts``
